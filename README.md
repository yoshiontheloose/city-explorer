## Overview

As a user of City Explorer, I want to enter the name of a location so that I can see the exact latitude and longitude of that location.

As a user, I want to see a map of the city so that I can see the layout of the area I want to explore.

As a user, I want clear messages if something goes wrong so I know if I need to make any changes or try again in a different manner.

<!-- Provide a high level overview of what this application is and why you are building it, beyond the fact that it's an assignment for this class. (i.e. What's your problem domain?) -->

## Getting Started

***Important BEFORE merging to GitHub***
Building an env file

- create a new file within the whole project
- file type is ".env" No additions, that's it.
- For a React App use this syntax:
  - `REACT_APP_`
- Follows with name/constant of your choosing
  - `REACT_APP_LOCATIONIQ_KEY`
- Assign with '=' then insert your key/token
  - `REACT_APP_LOCATIONIQ_KEY=bunchAgarbledMumboJumboThatIsYourToken`

Keep your key/token safe!
Do NOT call your entire key on app files, use the name ONLY!

***.env MUST BE ADDED TO YOUR .GITIGNORE. JUST .env NOTHING MORE***

<!-- What are the steps that a user must take in order to build this app on their own machine and get it running? -->

## Architecture

Built using

- React.js
- React Bootstrap
- Axios
- LocationIQ
<!-- Provide a detailed description of the application design. What technologies (languages, libraries, etc) you're using, and any other relevant design information. -->

## Change Log

8/4/2021 - Location latitude and longitude displays. Map of the city displays. Error message displays in React Alert component when necessary.

<!-- Use this area to document the iterative changes made to your application as each feature is successfully implemented. Use time stamps. Here's an example:

01-01-2001 4:59pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource. -->
